Instructions:
1.	Create a directory called ‘project’ anywhere inside ‘/content/drive/MyDrive/’.
2.	Upload all the files inside ‘project’ directory.
3.	Open the ‘frontend.ipynb’ file and execute cell by cell.
4.	Please make sure to assign the parent path variable properly with the correct path of the ‘project’ path created.

Notes:
1.	‘record.csv’ file is performing the role of a database in this use case, which contains some already test instances.
2.	After a query is performed in the app, if the customer instance is absent in the record.csv database, the prediction and recommendation is done and is updated in the database. Whereas, if any instance of the customer is already present, the last prediction already made is spilled and confirmation is asked if the user wants to add another instance in the record as shown below:
